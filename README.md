# Portfolio Optimization and Risk Management 

## Objective:
The objective of this project is to develop a comprehensive portfolio optimization model that balances risk and reward. The model utilizes various techniques including the efficient frontier, GARCH, EWMA models, simulation methods, and Gaussian Copula to estimate asset weights, market risk, and risk metrics such as Value-at-Risk (VAR) and Expected Shortfall (ES).
